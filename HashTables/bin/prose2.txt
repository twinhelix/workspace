What is quantum computing It's something that could have
been thought up a long time ago  an idea whose time has come
For any physical theory one can ask what sort of machines
will do useful computation or what sort of processes will count as
useful computational acts
Alan Turing thought about this in 1936
with regard implicitly to classical mechanics
and gave the world the paradime classical computer the Turing machine

But even in 1936 classical mechanics was known to be false
Work is now under way  mostly theoretical but tentatively hesitantly
groping towards the practical  in seeing what quantum mechanics
means for computers and computing

In a trivial sense everything is a quantum computer
A pebble is a quantum computer
for calculating the constant-position function
  you get the idea
And of course today's computers exploit quantum effects
like electrons tunneling through barriers
to help do the right thing and do it fast
For that matter both the computer and the pebble
exploit a quantum effect
  the Pauli exclusion principle which holds up ordinary matter against
collapse by bringing about the kind of degeneracy we call chemistry
  just to remain stable solid objects
But quantum computing is much more than that

The most exiting really new feature of quantum computing is
quantum parallelism
A quantum system is in general not in one classical state
but in a quantum state consisting crudely speaking
of a superposition of many classical or classical-like states
This superpisition is not just a figure of speech
covering up our ignorance of which classical-like state it's really in
If that was all the superposition meant you could drop all but one
of the classical-like states maybe only later after you deduced
retrospecktively which one was the right one and still get the
time evolution right
But actually you need the whole superposition
to get the time evolution right
The system really is in some sense
in all the classical-like states at once
If the superposition can be protected from unwanted
entanglement with its environment known as decoherence
a quantum computer can output results dependent on details of all
its classical-like states
This is quantum parallelism  paralellism on a serial machine
And if that wasn't enough machines that would already
in architectural terms qualify as parallel
can benifit from quantum parallellism too
  at which point the mind begins to seriously boggle
